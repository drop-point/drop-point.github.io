# Bridgetown Website README

Welcome to your new Bridgetown website! You can update this README file to provide additional context and setup information for yourself or other contributors.


## Development

To start your site in development mode, run `yarn start` and navigate to [localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000/)!

Use a [theme](https://github.com/topics/bridgetown-theme), add some [plugins](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/plugins/), and/or run some [automations](https://github.com/topics/bridgetown-automation) to get started quickly.

### Commands

```sh
# running locally
yarn start

# build & deploy to production
yarn deploy

# test
yarn test

# load the site up within a Ruby console (IRB)
bundle exec bridgetown console
```

## Deployment

You can deploy Bridgetown sites on "Jamstack" hosts (Netlify, Vercel, Render, etc.) or virtually any tranditional web server by simply building and copying the output folder to your HTML root.

> Read the [Bridgetown Deployment Documentation](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/deployment) for more information.
